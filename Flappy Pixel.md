A flappy bird clone, using very low res pixel art.

Some interesting twists

- procedural level generation which tweaks difficulty based on the number
  of times you've played and your top score.
- learner mode where a trace is drawn of where your avatar will be when it
  reaches any horizontal point - bars drawn for where you'll be after flapping
- power-ups or some such
